				  	<h2>Tennis</h2>
				  	<p>I'm passionate about tennis, which I've been playing since I was 8. I would like to compete and improve even more in this sport. I love playing tennis with family and friends especially at weekends, because it relaxes me after a long and complicated week.

				  	<h2>Theater</h2>
				  	<p>I'm also passionate about theater. I've been doing it for 3 years and it's really helped me on different points such as oral fluency, public speaking, etc. It's one of my passions because when I do it, I feel free to express whatever I want.

				<div class="card-white">
				  	<h2>Travel</h2>
				  	<p>Travelling abroad is also one of my passions. I've been traveling a lot since I was a little girl, especially with my family, and I love discovering new countries, new cultures and enriching my experiences abroad. It's something I want to discover for the rest of my life.
				  	</p>

				<div class="card-white">
				  	<h2>Music</h2>
				  	<p>I'm passionate about music. I listen to it all the time and of all kinds and I also play it, like piano or guitar. It's a way of expressing feelings in a different way, and also of escaping from everyday problems.
